                        <h3>Cricket:</h3>
                        <p>Our sports hall can cater for all our indoor cricket needs, providing full batting and bowling netting and matting for your practice sessions. We have 3 cricket clubs who book them for practice. Prices from as little as £59.60 per hour.</p>

                        <p>Indoor cricket nets differ significantly from outdoor nets. They are suspended on an aluminium track way (runners) which are fixed to the ceiling of sports hall or gymnasium. The nets can then drop 8–4 metres to reach the ground, before travelling at least 20 metres laterally, which provides a substantial practise enclosure.</p>
                        <p>Indoors nets are commonly multi lane, with 2 or 4 bay nets being particularly common, we have 3. Unlike outdoor cricket nets where the netting is black, indoor nets tend to be white.</p>
                        <p>They have a separate canvas screen which enclose the area immediately surrounding the batsman and rise to a height of 3 metres. The purpose of this is twofold; the netting to the sides and rear of the batsman has by far the highest work rate, canvas is significantly more durable to tradition mesh netting and as such the use of screens improves the life span of the net. The second is from a simply privacy aspect - the impression of seclusion allows for more focused batsman and reduces the risk of distractions. Indoor cricket nets will be found in almost all sports halls and gyms where the suspension on runners provides a curtain type system for the nets and allows the nets to be pulled in and out of use.</p>
